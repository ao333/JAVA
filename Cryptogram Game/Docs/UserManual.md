# SDPCryptogram
The player will try to guess the original message or "solution" by reviewing the Cryptogram and subsituting one letter for another.

#### Log In As Admin

#### Log In As Player
Logging in as Admin allows the user to Add New Players so their progress can be recorded
<br>*-Cryptogram and PlayerList are fetched upon login*

#### Add New Cryptograms 
Adding New Cryptograms require a Solution Phrase and a Matching Encoded Phrase, and a unique ID will be automatically assigned
<br>*-You may test your encryption with an "Implied Subsitution Cipher" which will ensure solution consistency. For example, an "a" may shift 2 letters to "c" in one place, but will not be allowed to shift to any other letter.*
